<p>Shirley earned her master’s degree in food science from UC Davis in 2013. Her master’s thesis was on the effect of different cold storage conditions on the quality of extra virgin olive oil. Olive oil study has been a good friend to her for the past five years, and will definitely be a life-long friend no matter what.</p>
<h2>Lauren Crawford</h2>

<p>My name is Lauren Crawford and I’m a first year Ph.D student in the Food Science and Technology department. I completed my BS in Food Science at Cornell University with a minor in Nutrition. I’m interested in food chemistry and its applications for improving the quality or healthfulness of products, so working with the UC Davis Olive Center seemed like a perfect fit. As my PhD project, I am helping to develop an innovative processing method for black table olives that reduces water usage/toxicity while increasing the olives’ nutritional content.</p>
<p>When I have free time, I enjoy running, reading, being outdoors, cooking and, of course, eating. I also love traveling and even got the opportunity to spend a semester abroad in Vienna, Austria. Having otherwise lived in upstate NY my whole life, I’m excited to now be experiencing a new part of the country. In the future, I hope to continue with research, either in an industry or academic setting.</p>
<h2>Juan Polari</h2>

<p>Juan is a first year PhD candidate at the Food Science and Technology department. He earned a degree in Chemistry from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. After graduating, he developed most of his professional experience in the field of fats and oils chemistry, focusing on quality assessment and bioactive compounds purification for food applications. He was fascinated by the world of olive oil while following a graduate course in olive oil sensory science at University of Jaén, Spain. At UC Davis Olive Center, he found an ideal place for further developing his academic training into this field. For his thesis project, Juan is studying the effect of processing conditions on sensory characteristics and chemical composition of virgin olive oils produced form super-high-density orchards in California. After finishing his graduate studies, he expects to contribute to the development of the olive oil industry in Argentina, working towards the integration of academic and productive sectors. In his free time, Juan enjoys cooking, reading and improvising endless blues solos in his guitar.</p>
<h2>Austin Phung</h2>

<p>My name is Austin Phung and I am currently a master’s student majoring in Pharmaceutical Chemistry. I joined the UC Davis Olive Center Chemistry Lab spring quarter of my junior year as an undergraduate. I initially joined this lab because of my interest in the chemistry, health aspects, and other chemical properties of olive oil. When I first joined this lab, I learned new lab techniques and gained hands on experience with helping Shirley, our assistant director, on different experiments. Specifically, helping her test parameters pertaining to total phenols, peroxide value (PV), and free fatty acids (FFA). Then, as a senior project, I worked on comparing and analyzing PV and FFA official methods to some proposed method counterparts. Then, I modified the proposed methods in order to create similar results to the official methods. This project gave me better insight on the subtleties between methods, in terms of reagents and the amount used. In addition, it helped me to become a better researcher by thinking carefully about the problem and coming up with a new way to approach it. Currently, my master’s project revolves around testing oxidation parameters in fish and fish oil supplements. As a pharmaceutical chemist, I take interest in medication that is sold on the market. In addition, this project would be a great way to help understand whether it is better to eat fish or take supplements. Furthermore, the information from this project could possibly help companies take action on the current processing, manufacturing, and packaging of these supplements. I hope to apply what I learned to certain areas in future research, like understanding the properties of olive oil, fish oil, or other natural products that can be used to help modify or create new medication. Overall, my ultimate dream is to work in a pharmaceutical company to help discover, modify, or synthesize drugs.</p>
