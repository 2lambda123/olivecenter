    <p>The world-renowned center brings together nearly 60 UC faculty members, research specialists and farm advisors who address the research and education needs of California olive growers and processors. The center also collaborates with institutions worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>The center’s co-chairs are Dr. Louise Ferguson, Extension Specialist in the Department of Plant Sciences and Dr. John Newman, Research Chemist at the USDA Western Human Nutrition Research Center and Assistant Adjunct Professor in the Department of Nutrition.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>What we do</h2>
    <p><b>Pursue innovation.</b> We pursue research with a fresh perspective, applying modern scientific knowledge and technology to an ancient crop.</p>
    <p><b>Provide services.</b> We offer best practices, university resources, and “must-attend” educational events.</p>
    <p><b>Push the tipping point.</b> We provide independent, research-based information to professional buyers and regulators to promote consumer embrace of quality.</p>
    <p>Since its founding in 2008, the Center has delivered more than $5 million in research and campus resources while supporting itself through <a href="/products">product sales</a>, <a href="/events">course revenue</a>, research grants, and <a href="/ways-to-give">donations.</a></p>
