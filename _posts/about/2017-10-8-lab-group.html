        <h2>Xueqi Shirley Li</h2>
        <p>Shirley is the assistant director at the UC Davis Olive Center. Her daily job includes making sure everyone
            is doing well and feeling happy in the lab, working with Selina on her wonderful and/or crazy research
            ideas, and working with Dan with various olive center events and product sales. When she’s not playing
            with HPLC or GC in the lab, she likes reading, traveling, and snuggling with her cats. Shirley earned her
            master’s degree in food science from UC Davis in 2013. Her master’s thesis was on the effect of different
            cold storage conditions on the quality of extra virgin olive oil. She’s also a member of the olive oil tasting
            panel at Applied Sensory, which is both AOCS and IOC certified.</p>

        <h2>Juan Polari</h2>
<p>Juan is a third year Ph.D. candidate in the Food Science and Technology department. He earned a degree in Chemistry from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he developed most of his professional experience working in the field of fats and oils chemistry, focusing on quality assessment and bioactive compound purification for food applications. Juan’s research focuses on the impact of processing variables on volatile and phenolic compounds composition of virgin olive oils. After finishing his graduate studies, he expects to contribute to the development of the olive oil industry working towards the integration of academic and productive sectors.</p>

        <h2>Hilary Green</h2>
<p>Hilary is a second year PhD student in the Agricultural and Environmental Chemistry Graduate group. She completed her Bachelors of Science in Chemistry from the University North Carolina at Chapel. Throughout undergrad, her research focused on water and air pollution, but she has always had a passion for food and agriculture. Now at UC Davis, she is excited to be working on method development for the food industry. Her current project focuses on developing a more time efficient and cost-effective way to determine the purity and quality of edible oils. She hopes to use her degree to continue research either working for industry or with the government. In her free time Hilary likes to use her chemistry knowledge for baking projects, especially making and decorating cakes! She also enjoys playing piano, singing in choir, and going on road trips.</p>

        <h2>Filipa Grilo</h2>
<p>My name is Filipa and I am a PhD student from the University of Palermo, Italy. As a visiting scholar at the Olive Centre, I study the influence of harvesting time and canopy position on the drupe maturation and olive oil quality. Starting my studies in Portugal I found a passion for fruit physiology that lead me to a master degree in horticultural sciences. During my master’s degree, I had the chance to learn more about the influence of agricultural practices on fruit minor compounds to improve their nutritional value. After developing my experimental work on the influence of irrigation and maturation on orange nutritional value in Italy, I choose to remain and apply for a PhD. For my PhD project, olives enter in my life! I study the Sicilian olive germplasm collection and the cultural factors affecting olive oil quality. At the Olive Centre, you can find me either in the lab or in the fields among olive trees! In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, cooking and most of all travelling. I had the opportunity to travel, work and live in different countries but here in California the olive center lab-group made me found a new home!

        <h2>Karen Cai</h2>
<p>Karen is currently a third year undergraduate majoring in Food Science and Technology and an intern for the Olive Center. When she is not working in the Olive Center, she is either busy running to class or trying new restaurants to eat. She particularly enjoys Asian cuisine and wants to learn how to make Chinese and Korean dishes at home when she has time. She enjoys boba (in moderation) and likes to exercise, whether it is going to the gym or playing tennis and badminton. She is also dedicated to Asian American Association at UC Davis and helps manage the club as one of the co-presidents. When it comes to academics, she is interested in microbiology and how it is integral in food safety and food science. She is excited to learn and grow her laboratory skills while at the Olive Center and hope to continue with research in the future.

        <h2>Thong Thomas Nguyen</h2>
<p>Thong Thomas Nguyen is currently a third year undergraduate student majoring in Food Science and Technology at UC Davis. He enjoys cooking, albeit at a beginner pace that will eventually accelerate. Biochemistry and microbiology are among his favorite topics to learn as they can be critical components in the dynamics of food production. Upon seeing a lack of Vietnamese cuisine in Davis, he would love for some outreach from Vietnamese communities. He is slightly addicted to coffee. Also working as an AATC tutor for brief organic chemistry, he does not mind working as a teacher one day. As an intern at the Olive Center, he aspires to be proficient in laboratory work and to explore new discoveries in the lab.

        <h2>Myhan Nguyen</h2>
<p>Myhan is a third-year Food Science student, with a minor in Technology Management. Growing up, she has valued olive oil for its versatility in cooking, its complex flavors, and its health properties. Her curiosities about olive oil quality has lead her to the Olive Center, where she learns about analytical testing methods by assisting in various research projects. As an aspiring food scientist, her interests lie in food chemistry and sensory science. Outside of research, Myhan is actively involved in the Food Science and Technology Department. She is an officer for Food Tech Club and works as an academic peer advisor.
