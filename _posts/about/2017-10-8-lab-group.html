        <h2>Xueqi Shirley Li</h2>
        <p>Shirley is the assistant director at the UC Davis Olive Center. Her daily job includes making sure everyone
            is doing well and feeling happy in the lab, working with Selina on her wonderful and/or crazy research
            ideas, and working with Dan with various olive center events and product sales. When she’s not playing
            with HPLC or GC in the lab, she likes reading, traveling, and snuggling with her cats. Shirley earned her
            master’s degree in food science from UC Davis in 2013. Her master’s thesis was on the effect of different
            cold storage conditions on the quality of extra virgin olive oil. She’s also a member of the olive oil tasting
            panel at Applied Sensory, which is both AOCS and IOC certified.</p>

        <h2>Lauren Crawford</h2>
<p>Lauren Crawford is a 4th year PhD candidate in Food Science and Technology. She received her B.S. in Food Science from Cornell University with a minor in Nutritional Sciences. Lauren’s research focuses on improving the quality, safety and authenticity of California-style table olives. She has been involved with food science outreach on campus including STEM for Girls and FFA Field Day. In her free time, Lauren enjoys running, reading, cooking, and playing piano. She also loves traveling and had the opportunity to study in Austria for 6 months. In the future, Lauren hopes to continue with research in an industry or government position.</p>

        <h2>Juan Polari</h2>
<p>Juan is a third year Ph.D. candidate in the Food Science and Technology department. He earned a degree in Chemistry from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he developed most of his professional experience working in the field of fats and oils chemistry, focusing on quality assessment and bioactive compound purification for food applications. Juan’s research focuses on the impact of processing variables on volatile and phenolic compounds composition of virgin olive oils. After finishing his graduate studies, he expects to contribute to the development of the olive oil industry working towards the integration of academic and productive sectors.</p>

        <h2>Hilary Green</h2>
<p>Hilary is a second year PhD student in the Agricultural and Environmental Chemistry Graduate group. She completed her Bachelors of Science in Chemistry from the University North Carolina at Chapel. Throughout undergrad, her research focused on water and air pollution, but she has always had a passion for food and agriculture. Now at UC Davis, she is excited to be working on method development for the food industry. Her current project focuses on developing a more time efficient and cost-effective way to determine the purity and quality of edible oils. She hopes to use her degree to continue research either working for industry or with the government. In her free time Hilary likes to use her chemistry knowledge for baking projects, especially making and decorating cakes! She also enjoys playing piano, singing in choir, and going on road trips.</p>

        <h2>Filipa Grilo</h2>
<p>My name is Filipa and I am a PhD student from the University of Palermo, Italy. As a visiting scholar at the Olive Centre, I study the influence of harvesting time and canopy position on the drupe maturation and olive oil quality. Starting my studies in Portugal I found a passion for fruit physiology that lead me to a master degree in horticultural sciences. During my master’s degree, I had the chance to learn more about the influence of agricultural practices on fruit minor compounds to improve their nutritional value. After developing my experimental work on the influence of irrigation and maturation on orange nutritional value in Italy, I choose to remain and apply for a PhD. For my PhD project, olives enter in my life! I study the Sicilian olive germplasm collection and the cultural factors affecting olive oil quality. At the Olive Centre, you can find me either in the lab or in the fields among olive trees! In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, cooking and most of all travelling. I had the opportunity to travel, work and live in different countries but here in California the olive center lab-group made me found a new home!
