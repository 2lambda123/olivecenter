        <h2>Xueqi Shirley Li</h2>
        <p>Shirley is the assistant director at the UC Davis Olive Center. Her daily job includes making sure everyone
            is doing well and feeling happy in the lab, working with Selina on her wonderful and/or crazy research
            ideas, and working with Dan with various olive center events and product sales. When she’s not playing
            with HPLC or GC in the lab, she likes reading, traveling, and snuggling with her cats. Shirley earned her
            master’s degree in food science from UC Davis in 2013. Her master’s thesis was on the effect of different
            cold storage conditions on the quality of extra virgin olive oil. She’s also a member of the olive oil tasting
            panel at Applied Sensory, which is both AOCS and IOC certified.</p>

        <h2>Filipa Grilo</h2>
<p>My name is Filipa and I am a PhD student from the University of Palermo, Italy. As a visiting scholar at the Olive Centre, I study the influence of harvesting time and canopy position on the drupe maturation and olive oil quality. Starting my studies in Portugal I found a passion for fruit physiology that lead me to a master degree in horticultural sciences. During my master’s degree, I had the chance to learn more about the influence of agricultural practices on fruit minor compounds to improve their nutritional value. After developing my experimental work on the influence of irrigation and maturation on orange nutritional value in Italy, I choose to remain and apply for a PhD. For my PhD project, olives enter in my life! I study the Sicilian olive germplasm collection and the cultural factors affecting olive oil quality. At the Olive Centre, you can find me either in the lab or in the fields among olive trees! In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, cooking and most of all travelling. I had the opportunity to travel, work and live in different countries but here in California the olive center lab-group made me found a new home!

          <h2>Sherina Sim</h2>
          <p>My name is Sherina, and I recently received my Bachelor's in Food Science from UC Davis. Being a research assistant in the Olive Center have allowed me to develop my interest in food chemistry, and pursue my hidden fascination for olive oils. I thoroughly enjoyed taking part in projects that involve conducting analytical tests to assess olive oil quality and authenticity, and to quantify chemical compounds naturally found in other food ingredients. Working in the laboratory helps me discover what I am passionate about, and I am very grateful to be given the opportunity to contribute to the Olive Center. After a long day in the lab, I like to loosen myself up by cooking (or baking) something delicious in the kitchen, and enjoy them while watching YouTube with my cats snuggling around me.</p>

<p>My name is Jie Ding. I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Food Science. The first time I heard about the UC Davis Olive Center was through a recruiting email from the Food Science Department. I was looking for an internship opportunity to gain more experience in the lab. It was exactly what I was looking for. As an undergraduate research assistant intern, I was able to learn many useful methods, laboratory technique, and familiarize with olive products. During my free time, I love playing with my cats, sleeping, watching cooking videos, and discovering good restaurants around the world. </p>

        <p>Hello, my name is Andres Gonzalez. I am a fourth-year food science major and very interested in learning about the many analytical methods utilized in examining the chemical components of food. Fortunately, interning at the olive center has provided me with that opportunity as well learning more information about olives and olive oil that I never knew existed. In my spare time I enjoy cooking, reading, and going to concerts. My future aspirations include working in the food industry in research and development or as a food safety auditor. Ideally, I would then attend grad school followed by working as a food scientist for NASA to develop food for astronauts.</p>

          <h2>Gerald Malvin</h2>
          <p>My name is Gerald Malvin. I am currently a third year undergraduate student majoring in Food Science. As someone who came from a country where olive oil is not common, I was not familiar with olive oil prior to coming to the United States. I first knew of the Olive Center when a tasting session was held back in my freshman year when I was interning for Aggie Grown. I became interested because I didn't know there was so much behind olive oil in terms of flavor and chemical attributes. In my short time here as a lab intern, I have learned so much in terms of familiarizing myself with the different laboratory equipment that are used to measure various parameters of the olive oil. I am really excited to learn even more because I believe that the experiences i gain from this internship will be important for my future professional career.</p>

        <p>Hi! My name is Chang Lin. I am a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in Food Science and Technology. I am from Guangzhou, a city in southern China. I joined the UC Davis Olive center because of my strong interest in the chemistry and preservation of olive oil. I learned a lot of lab techniques and knowledge on olive oil processing after participating in the lab as a research assistant. In the past 3 years, I learned the major lab techniques in Olive Center, and I am now conducting my own research project. In my free time, I like to learn new languages and try new cooking recipes. It is an honor to work in the lab, especially among talented researchers and other amazing interns.

<p>I am Gary Adrian, and I am a third-year Food Science major student in University of California, Davis. I first learned about the UC Davis Olive Center when I volunteered for olive oil tasting tabling event during Picnic Day 2015, and since then my interest in olive oil has kept getting bigger. Growing up not using olive oil in my food, I never know how a humble food ingredient such as olive oil can have such complex attributes that constitute its quality. In the UC Davis Olive Center, I learn about the different chemical parameters and benefits of olive oil that makes me appreciate olive oil even more. The learning process here is very eye-opening, and I am excited to learn even more on how to produce olive oil with the highest quality.
