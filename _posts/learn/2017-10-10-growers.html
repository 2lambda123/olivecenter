                <p><b>It is critical to assess climate before planting olives in a particular site:</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Winter. Ideally, winter temperatures should fluctuate between 35 °F (2 °C) and 65 °F (18 °C). Temperatures below freezing cause progressively more tree damage, from small shoot and branch lesions that provide entry points for olive knot
                    bacteria at 23 °F to 32 °F (-5 °C to 0 °C), greater tissue damage at 14 °F to 23 °F (-5 °C to -10 °C) and death of large limbs and entire trees at temperatures below 14 °F (-10 °C).</li>
                  <li>Spring. The bloom development period should be free of prolonged cold and wet or hot and dry weather. These conditions hinder flower development, pollination, fertilization and fruit set. Long or sudden cold spells particularly increase
                    the negative impact.</li>
                  <li>Summer. Long, warm and dry summers promote good fruit development. Avoid areas with summer rainfall and high humidity, which promote fungal and bacterial diseases.</li>
                </ul>

              <div class="media-body">
                <ul>
                  <li>Fall. Temperatures below freezing often damage processing quality of fruit destined for either table or oil. Pay special attention to low-lying areas, which are especially vulnerable to colder temperatures. Fall rains improve size and
                    value of fruits destined for table processing, but make fruit destined for oil processing more susceptible to damage, fermentation and mold and may contribute to emulsions that hinder oil extraction Rains at harvest can also hinder
                    mechanical harvest equipment from accessing the orchard.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Research the site history.</strong> Find out crop history from the previous landowner and, where relevant, the local agricultural commissioner’s office. Avoid soil previously planted with crops (such as cotton, cucurbits, eggplant,
                  peppers, potato, or tomato) susceptible to the Verticillium wilt fungus, a soil-borne disease that kills olive trees. There are limited Verticillium wilt management strategies available to growers.</p>

                <p><strong>Analyze the soil profile.</strong> Managed correctly, olives perform well in many soils, even those considered marginal in quality. Soil maps do not provide sufficient detail for specific orchard sites. Use a backhoe or augur and
                  dig pits in representative places on the planting site. Examine the soil’s physical condition, including layers that are texturally different, to identify limitations on root and water penetration. Olives do not grow well in poorly drained
                  soils. The best and most productive soils are those un-stratified, moderately fine-textured of at least 4 ft (1.2 m) in depth.</p>
                <p><strong>Determine the soil chemistry.</strong> Take a representative soil sample from the orchard site and submit it to a laboratory for analysis. The best soils are those moderately acid to moderately alkaline (pH between 6.5 to 8.5).
                  Soil below pH 5.5 can have aluminum and manganese toxicity, while soil above pH 8.5 have poor structure and may have sodium toxicity. Avoid soils high in salinity (≥4 dS/m). To avoid water penetration problems due to poor soil structure,
                  avoid soils with an exchangeable sodium percentage of &gt; 4 or be prepared to amend such soils to leach excessive sodium.Avoid soils with excessive boron (≥2 ppm), and chloride (10-15 meq/l) as these conditions may reduce productivity
                  unless corrected or managed with soil amendments requiring additional expense.</p>

                <p><strong>Assess water availability</strong>. Although olive trees are drought tolerant, they will grow faster and produce more consistently in California with supplemental irrigation. Supplemental irrigation water can be available as irrigation
                  district water (surface water) or by farm wells. Sites served only by irrigation districts are at risk of water shortage during drought years.Inadequate water during floral development can lead to poor fruit set especially if adverse
                  weather occurs during or shortly after bloom. Inadequate water through the growing season can limit fruit size for table olive growers. Choose sites that can supply olive trees with approximately three acre-feet per year for table olives
                  and two acre-feet per year for oil olives, although more water will be necessary if irrigation efficiency is compromised by conditions such as runoff or poor weed control.</p>

                    <p>Traditional California olive orchards were large trees at planted at low densities; typically less than 85 trees/ac (205 trees/ha), hand-harvested and hand-pruned. Increasing harvest costs and uncertain labor availability have resulted in many
                      California olive oil growers and a few table olive growers planting higher-density, hedgerow configured orchards. In hedgerow orchards, both the in-row and between-row spacing is tighter, ranging from “high-density” (HD) orchards of about 200
                      trees/ac (482 trees/ha) to “super-high-density” (SHD) orchards of about 650 trees/ac (1567/ha). Both HD and SHD orchards facilitate mechanical harvesting and pruning while also intercepting the optimal percentage of incident light to maximize
                      yield.
                    </p>
                    <p>Most California olive oil acreage favors the SHD format, which requires clones of specific varieties developed for these orchards. Typically SHD oil olives are harvested with over-the-row, canopy-contact harvesters. A few California olive oil
                      growers and table olive growers have adopted HD orchard densities, which can be harvested with trunk shakers for the first 15 years, and then possibly harvested with canopy-contact equipment when trunk-shaking efficiency declines. University
                      of California (UC) researchers have developed specifications for an efficient canopy-contact harvester head for oil and table olive hedgerow orchards. UC has provided these specifications to commercial harvest equipment manufacturers.</p>
                    <p>UC cost studies for establishing and producing table and oil olives in a hedgerow orchard are available at <a href="http://coststudies.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">http://coststudies.ucdavis.edu/.</a> UC cost studies are based on specific assumptions
                      -- but not all practices, and particularly quoted prices, may be applicable to every grower’s situation. Growers should use these cost studies as beginning templates and modify them to a given situation and local costs. The grower then can use
                      the ranging analyses in the studies to determine if table or oil olive production is feasible in a specific location.</p>
                    <p>The following best practices for establishing hedgerow orchards were based on UC research. When UC data-based information was unavailable, the best practices were based on research outside of California as well as current predominant California
                      industry practices. Except where indicated, the recommendations apply whether the orchard is intended for oil, table or dual varieties.</p>

                    <p>Nurseries may need a year’s notice to ensure selected varieties are available for spring planting. California’s “ripe” table olive processors primarily favor Manzanillo with Sevillano (Gordal) as a pollinizer, while Sicilian-style and Spanish-style
                      processers prefer Sevillano (Gordal). Small table olive processors have used other varieties for these and other curing styles. Arbequina is California’s most widely planted oil variety, although California oil producers have marketed all varieties
                      in the table below as single-varietal olive oils, even traditional table olive varieties such as Ascolano, Mission, Sevillano and Manzanillo.</p>
                    <p>When selecting varieties, consider:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>When choosing varieties for olive oil processing, also consider:</p>

                      <li>oil content</li>
                      <li>extraction efficiency</li>
                      <li>flavor characteristics</li>
                      <li>stability (which correlates with high polyphenol levels and high oleic acid content)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When choosing varieties for table olive processing, in general, also consider:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>high flesh-to-pit ratio</li>
                      <li>large fruit size (larger sizes typically receive a higher price than smaller sizes)</li>
                      <li>excellent flesh quality (such as resistance to bruising if the olives will be cured green, and desirable sensory characteristics for the anticipated curing method)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>No single olive variety has every desirable characteristic.

                      pre- or post-emergent herbicides. Control most perennial weeds (e.g., bermudagrass, dallisgrass, and johnsongrass) by repeated disking and drying during summer. Control field bindweed by irrigating to produce a vigorous plant and then treating
                      with glyphosate or 2,4-D, followed in 10 days by disking and drying the soil.</p>

                      drainage, but they can also limit irrigation hose placement and decrease trellis integrity. Berms may also decrease drainage thereby increasing the potential for root disease when the orchard slope is perpendicular to the berms. Berms are

                    <p>High-Density (HD) hedgerow orchards in California have ranged from 200 trees/acre to 269 trees per acre, while Super-High-Density (SHD) hedgerow orchards, which are used exclusively for oil production, have ranged from 453 trees/acre to 908
                      trees/acre, with most SHD orchards planted at about 650 trees/ac (1567/ha).</p>
                    <p>Tree spacing in hedgerow orchards should be dictated by harvest equipment. Most SHD olive oil growers use over-the-row harvesters while <a href="http://ucanr.edu/sites/mecholive/" target="_blank">UC research</a> has demonstrated trunk shakers
                      and canopy-contact harvesters can be efficient for HD table olive harvesting. The SHD system works best with clones of specific varieties such as Arbequina, Arbosana and Koroneiki, while the HD system can accept many olive varieties.</p>
                    <p>In general, SHD orchards are more expensive to establish than HD orchards, but SHD orchards will achieve maximum income sooner than HD orchards. Both orchards have similar maximum income and expenses over time based on data from the Australian
                      olive oil industry.</p>

                    <p>A trellis and tree stakes support trees, prevents misshapen trees due to wind and ensures a straight tree row to facilitate the over-the-row harvesters in SHD olive oil orchards. A trellis is essential in an SHD orchard but not essential or
                      usually needed in HD orchards. Stakes, however, are necessary to develop a straight single trunk.</p>
                    <p><b>Trellis and stakes.</b> A standard SHD trellis uses 8 ft (2.4 m) treated round end posts, with 8 ft (2.4 m) metal T-posts placed at 55 ft (16.8 m) intervals and 12-gauge galvanized wire installed at 4.5 ft (1.4 m) and 6 ft (1.8 m), secured
                      to the T-posts and bamboo tree stakes with wire clips. SHD growers in California are moving toward smaller trellises with 6 ft (2 m) end posts and 6 ft (2 m) T-posts driven 2 ft (0.6 m) into the ground, and a single wire placed at 3 ft (1
                      m). If one wants to use a trellis in a standard HD orchard, use 12 ft (3.7 m) treated-wood or iron posts that are round or 4 x 4 inches (10 x 10 cm) square, placed at the ends of rows and at 100 ft (30 m) intervals, with 12-gauge galvanized
                      wire installed at 3, 6 and 9 ft (1, 2, and 3 m.) SHD and HD trellised orchards provide a 7 ft (2.1 m) bamboo stake at each tree and tie the central leader to the stake at 8 to 14 inch (20 to 35 cm) intervals as the leader grows.</p>
                    <p><b>Stakes only.</b> When using stakes without a trellis in an HD orchard located in windy areas, use treated wood stakes that are 2 x 2 inches (5 cm) square and 8 ft (1.5 to 2.5 m) in height. Tie the central leader to the stake at 2.5 ft (75
                      cm) intervals. Lighter bamboo stakes can be used in areas with little wind.</p>

                    <p>A micro-irrigation system such as drip, fan jet, or micro-sprinkler, provides higher efficiency (85-95%) than large sprinklers (75-85%) or furrow irrigation (65-75%) by minimizing water losses due to runoff and evaporation. The higher efficiency
                      of micro-irrigation systems also reduces orchard humidity compared to larger sprinklers, reducing risks related to fungal diseases.</p>
                    <p>Micro-irrigation systems are often designed to permit fertigation, the application of plant nutrients or water amendments in the irrigation water. Fertigation has the advantages of maintaining moisture in the wetted area, encouraging the development
                      of new roots, extending the period of maximum root activity, improving plant nutrient absorption and providing a constant supply of nutrients based on the tree’s needs. The two objectives of fertigation are to maximize profit and reduce
                      adverse environmental effects. Profit is maximized when fertilizer remains in the wetted zone where root density is greatest. Adverse environmental impacts are minimized by not allowing fertilizer to leach below the wetted root zone and
                      pollute groundwater.</p>
                    <p>Filtration is a significant cost in installing micro-irrigation systems and is essential to mitigate clogging due to bacterial growth. Chemigation valves are also required to prevent back flow of chemicals as well as chemical precipitation
                      in the laterals and emitters.</p>
                    <p>Maximizing benefits from drip and micro-irrigation systems requires the system to be designed properly, installed correctly and managed effectively. Neglecting these factors can lead to poor results.</p>
                    <p>Install the irrigation system prior to planting. Irrigate the orchard prior to planting if soils are dry. Planting in dry soil will cause moisture to migrate from the root ball to the soil, resulting in root death in very young trees.</p>

                    <p>There are two objectives to tree training during the first three years: (1) developing a sturdy, well-spaced framework of uncongested scaffold branches to support heavy crops and mechanical harvesting, and (2) bringing the tree into bearing
                      as quickly as possible. Pruning must be sufficient to achieve the first objective, but minimized to promote the second.</p>
                    <p>Avoid training and pruning during dormancy. Such pruning requires heavier cutting and renders the tree more susceptible to freeze injury and disease.</p>
                    <p>For HD orchards, remove shoots below a 2.5 ft (75 cm) height, and pinch the leader at 36 to 40 inches (1 m) to stimulate lateral growth if lateral shoots above 2.5 ft (75 cm) have not already begun in the nursery. Remove suckers and waterspouts
                      (which are the angular, succulent herbaceous growth, often pale green in color, that shoot straight upward) as early as possible.</p>
                    <p>For SHD orchards, remove shoots within the protective carton and 8 in (20 cm) above the carton to maintain a single leader. Remove competing limbs as the leader approaches the top wire. When the leader is 12-18 in (30-46 cm) above the top
                      wire, prune a handful of shoots, and tip 10-20 shoots along the sides of the tree to promote dense foliage and more fruitwood.</p>
                    <p>Further training of trees depends on the method of harvest:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Trunk shaker. Prune to direct the growth into stiff upright scaffolds that transmit the force from the trunk shaking. Remove branches below a 45o angle from the vertical as they shake less efficiently. Remove branches extending laterally
                        into the row middle, which reduce harvester efficiency.</li>
                      <li>Canopy-contact and over-the-row harvesters. Canopy contact harvesters remove olives with two different mechanisms. Some compress and agitate the canopy with a series of horizontal bars called bow rods that agitate the canopy with a vertical
                        motion. Some have a head with vertical rows of radiating tines that extend into the canopy. The horizontal whipping motion at the tips of these tines against the vertical branches removes the olives. Both removal methods remove the fruit
                        on the outer canopy more efficiently than interior fruit. Train the tree into an upright narrow canopy, with primary scaffolds parallel to the tree row and shorter branches extending into the row. Such training, achieved by hand pruning,
                        mechanical pruning or both, will facilitate production of a continuous flat fruiting wall. Remove branches that extend into the row middle. These branches will interfere with harvester efficiency, can damage harvest equipment, and will
                        probably be broken by the harvester.</li>
