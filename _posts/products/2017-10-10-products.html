        <h2>Koroneiki Olive Oil</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Koroneiki is a gold medal winner at the California State Fair Extra
          Virgin Olive Oil Competition
        </p>
        <p>
          In Greece the Koroneiki is considered "the queen of olives" and is
          recognized globally as one of the preferred varietals for oil
          production. The Koreneiki tree has grown there for more than 3000
          years and is a prolific producer. While the olives themselves are very
          small, they contain very high levels of polyphenols, the natural
          antioxidants found in plants that may reduce the risk of heart disease
          and cancer. Polyphenols and other antioxidants found in olives can
          protect the human body against free radical damage. The Koroneiki
          olive, picked while still green, is highly prized for its aromatic,
          strongly flavored oil, perfect for in its natural raw state or added
          at the end of cooking. Oil from the Koroneiki olive has a complex
          aroma, often with subtle hints of other herbs and vegetation growing
          in or near the groves. This olive oil contains fruit and floral notes
          that make it perfect for finishing any dish!

          This UC Davis Special Edition Olive Oil is grown, harvested, milled,
          pressed, bottled, and designed 100% by UC Davis students at local
          orchards under the direction and guidance of the Robert Mondavi
          Institute. Even the Olive plant image on the label was drawn by a
          student in the program!
