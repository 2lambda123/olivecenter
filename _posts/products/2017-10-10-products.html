          This delicious Extra Virgin olive oil is made from a 50-50 field blend
          of Mission and Picual olives. Mission cultivar has a centuries long
          history in California, it’s an adapted selection that is also c
          considered by many as our California own variety. When it’s harvested
          early in the season is bitter and pungent, buttery, and soft later in
          the season. Picual is the most known and grown Spanish cultivar. This
          olive oil blend has notes of green tomato, fresh cut grass and fruit.
          Robust, bitter and with peppery notes, enjoy on complex cheeses such
          as Manchego.

        <h2>Koroneiki Extra Virgin Olive Oil</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Koroneiki is a gold medal winner at the California State Fair Extra
          Virgin Olive Oil Competition
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Special Edition UC Davis Olive Center Koroneiki is a 2023 gold
          medal winner at the California State Fair Extra Virgin Olive Oil
          Competition In Greece ‘Koroneiki’ is considered "the queen of olives"
          and is recognized globally as one of the preferred variety for oil
          production. The Koreneiki tree has grown there for more than 3000
          years and is a prolific producer. While the olives themselves are very
          small, they contain very high levels of polyphenols, the natural
          antioxidants found in plants that may reduce the risk of heart disease
          and cancer. Polyphenols and other antioxidants found in olives can
          protect the human body against free radical damage. The Koroneiki
          olive, picked while still green, is highly prized for its aromatic,
          strongly flavored oil, perfect for its natural raw state or added at
          the end of cooking. Oil from the Koroneiki olive has a complex aroma,
          often with subtle hints of green herbs and vegetation. Our UC Davis
          Koroneiki Extra Virgin olive oil has grassy and green banana and
          plantain notes with hints floral tones that make it perfect for
          finishing any dish!
