            <p>He is the founder & CEO of the Olive Truck, a premier mobile milling company based in San Francisco, California. Sam had established a similar mobile milling company in his native Turkey, where he sought out obscure native cultivars and would bottle single-varietal oils. </p>
            <p>Sam designed his mobile mill with the newest olive processing technology, all in a standard shipping container that can be easily off-loaded at an orchard site. The trailer travels directly to California olive groves to produce some of the freshest and highest quality olive oil in the world. His olive oils have received top awards from international competitions in Los Angeles, New York and Milan.</p>
