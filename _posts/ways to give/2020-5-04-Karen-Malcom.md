Karen and Malcolm Bond have been strong supporters of the Olive Center. In addition to providing regular financial contributions, Malcolm has expertly crafted olive oil from UC Davis olives, Karen serves as a valued member of the center’s Executive Advisory Board. Both also share their insights with other producers on what it takes to be successful in the olive oil business. 

The Bonds also have hosted Olive Center guests at their home and milling facility, Bondolio. They were inspired to produce olive oil after a trip to Italy where they first tasted freshly milled olive oil. They searched in Italy for a company that could teach them how to produce and market olive oil but were told no such thing existed. Eventually a connection in Italy pointed the Bonds to the UC Davis Olive Center, located just 15 minutes from the Bond farm!

The Bonds are annual attendees of the Olive Center’s world-renowned Master Milling course, where they learned the keys to producing top-quality olive oil. Through hard work, attention to detail and a commitment to excellence, their premium extra virgin olive oil has become a steady winner of best-of-show and gold awards in international competitions. 

Malcolm received a PhD in Physiology from UC Davis and with Karen founded Cedaron, a Davis-based innovator in electronic health records. The Bonds support many worthwhile efforts with their time and philanthropy, including Angel Flight West, in which Malcolm pilots needy people requiring medical care at no charge. They often sponsor the Davis Race Team and Davis Junior Race Team.
