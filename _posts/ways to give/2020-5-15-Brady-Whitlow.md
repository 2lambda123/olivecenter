With Brady’s support Corto has generously donated olive oil to the center when campus supplies were not enough for demand. The company helped contribute to the first instrument we purchased for our laboratory in 2010. Corto also has been a regular sponsor of our events and has welcomed students for tours of Corto’s Stockton orchards and processing facility.

Corto has been an innovative processor that experiments with new approaches and technology to increase quality and extraction. The company has found much success in focusing on restaurants and food service providers.
