Felix Musco has assisted the Olive Center from its planning stages, has provided generous sponsorships of the center’s events and was instrumental in the center collaborating with table olive growers.  He is a member of the center’s Executive Advisory Board, guiding the preparation and implementation of the center’s strategic plan and its collaboration with olive producers. 

As the chief operating officer at Musco Family Olive Company, one of the world’s major olive producers, Felix has overseen the modernization of California table olive production by encouraging the development of higher density orchards to allow for mechanical harvesting. He is the third-generation to head this family-owned company since its establishment in 1942.
