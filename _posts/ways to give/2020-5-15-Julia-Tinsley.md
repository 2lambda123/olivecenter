Julia Tinsley is the Senior Corporate Manager of QA and R&D at Bell-Carter Foods, Inc. — a company which produces half of the black-ripe olives in the United States. She helps guide table olive research as a board member of the California Olive Committee.

Her support for the Olive Center stems from her collaboration on research projects across the board, from growing to processing and everything in between. With her generous help, the Olive Center has conducted research to shed light on issues in the olive industry that had little to no representation, including acrylamide and styrene analysis.
