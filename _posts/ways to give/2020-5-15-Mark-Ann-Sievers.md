They also have supported the Olive Center by attending and sending their staff to our courses. We appreciate their unflagging support for our students and research.

Il Fiorello is nestled between Fairfield and Napa in Green Valley and Suisun Valley. The Sievers carefully adhere to best practices for producing high-quality olive oil and they grow 13 varieties sourced from many Mediterranean countries. They mill for 243 growers from the Wine Country and beyond. Il Fiorello extra virgin olive oils consistently receive top awards in international competitions.

Ann Sievers is a third-generation descendant of Dominic Fiorello, tracing back roots to Sicily and a village north of Naples. The Sievers believe in healthy nutrition and sustainable agriculture, associating with the Slow Food Movement. They approach olive oil production with old-world dedication and new-world innovation, including firing an innovative energy co-generation system with their dried olive pomace.
