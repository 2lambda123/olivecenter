Mary is the Director of Technical Services at the California Olive Ranch (COR). With Mary’s advocacy COR has sponsored multi-year fellowships for the Olive Center’s graduate students. Mary says that our students perform well in areas such as methodology, analysis, and adaptability. Her help with the sponsorships provided students with valuable experience and expanded the center’s research. 

Since its inception, COR has been among the top producers of California olive oil and has been a strong supporter of the Olive Center. Mary has numerous responsibilities in her position including: managing quality and food safety systems and coordinating a sensory program to assess and provide consistent products to their customers. She graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Food Science & Technology.
