Thom has provided his mobile mill and crew for our Master Milling course without charge so that the attendees can experience the milling process. Thom and his crew worked with instructor Leandro Ravetti to implement experimental trials during the course so that attendees learn the impact that variables can have on yield and quality. The Olive Center very much appreciates the expense that Thom incurred in transporting the mill hundreds of miles from Riverside County to Davis and back.

Thom owns Temecula Olive Oil Company, selling a variety of olive oils, balsamic vinegars, artisan foods, and bath and body essentials. He also is experimenting with a wide variety of olive cultivars in the desert climate of eastern Riverside County, expanding the potential growing areas of California. Thom serves as a sensory panelist for the California Olive Oil Council.
