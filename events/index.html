          <p>
            Introduction to Sensory Evaluation of Olive Oil from the UC Davis
            Olive Center is our first 2022 event with two days of olive oil
            sensory instruction including tasting, lectures, and roundtable
            discussions. This practical educational program is designed to
            provide a solid foundation for understanding and evaluating olive
            oil. In addition to learning about the positive sensory attributes
            and the defects of olive oil, you will start to explore the factors
            that influence olive oil flavor and how quality is measured. We will
            experiment with food and extra virgin olive oil pairings and discuss
            the culinary use of this transformative ingredient. At the end you
            will receive a certificate for the introductory level of our olive
            oil tasting series as part of our comprehensive olive educational
            programming.

            We’ll be tasting a selection of UC Davis olive oils. Sales of these
            products are an integral component of the Olive Center's
            self-supporting efforts, to continue to provide olive research and
            education to students, industry deleted leaders and consumers. The
            center’s main goal is doing for olives what UC Davis has done for
            wine. The selection of oils will include:
