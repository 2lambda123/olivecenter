            <p><b>Reviews from 2019 Course:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"Presenters and their content and delivery were spot on for what we, as a diverse group of olive oil lovers, need to become discriminating tasters. I am impressed with the organization and how well the book was put together. This attention to detail mirrored the professionalism of all involved to make this a successful day for us."</li>
              <li>"I'm in awe of how much I learned during this two day course. I came into it an olive oil novice and I feel so much more confident talking about extra virgin olive oil and understanding what I'm tasting. Thank you so much, Sue!"</li>

            <h2>Master Milling Certificate Course</h2>
            <p><b>September 21-23, 2020</b></p>
            <p>The Master Milling Certificate Course has helped hundreds of olive oil processors produce better oil more efficiently. The course will be led by Leandro Ravetti, among the world’s top experts in olive oil processing, growing, and standards. As executive director of Australia’s Boundary Bend Limited, Leandro has helped guide the company to rapid growth, optimum efficiency, and top awards at international olive oil competitions. </p>
            <p><b>Reviews from 2019 Course:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>“Without this class, we would not be able to make high-quality, award-winning extra virgin olive oil. The price of this seminar is a bargain. As an investment, the first year’s crop paid for the class many times over.”</li>
              <li>“The course covers some of the most advanced approaches to milling available, but also covers the basic fundamentals. What I learned immediately is that a lot of the old milling ‘lore’ circulating the industry in California simply wasn’t true or backed by any evidence. The course is a huge first step in demystifying the milling process so we can innovate and produce better oils.”</li>
