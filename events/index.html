           <p>Introduction to Sensory Evaluation of Olive Oil from the UC Davis Olive Center is our first 2022 event with two days of olive oil sensory instruction including tasting, lectures, and roundtable discussions. This practical educational program is designed to provide a solid foundation for understanding and evaluating olive oil.

            <p><b>June 23, 9:00 – 10:30 AM</b></p>
            <p>Compared to traditional production, modern table olive acreage features:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>higher-density planting of ~200 - 250 trees/acre (compared to less than 100 trees/acre)</li>
                <li>
                  yields up to 6+ tons/acre (compared to 10-year industry average of 3.25 tons/acre)
                </li>
              <li>mechanical harvesting (compared to hand labor, which is more costly and not always available)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The webinar will feature Dan Flynn, founding director of the UC Davis Olive Center, who will summarize key elements of siting, establishing, maintaining and harvesting modern acreage.
