            <p><b>Friday &amp; Saturday June 24-25, 2022</b> <br>8:30 AM – 4:00 PM.</p>
           <p>Introduction to Sensory Evaluation of Olive Oil from the UC Davis Olive Center is our first 2022 event with two days of olive oil sensory instruction including tasting, lectures, and roundtable discussions. This practical educational program is designed to provide a solid foundation for understanding and evaluating olive oil. In addition to learning about the positive sensory attributes and the defects of olive oil, you will start to explore the factors that influence olive oil flavor and how quality is measured. We will experiment with food and extra virgin olive oil pairings and discuss the culinary use of this transformative ingredient. At the end you will receive a certificate for the introductory level of our olive oil tasting series as part of our comprehensive olive educational programming. </p>

            <p><b>June 23, 9:00 – 10:30 AM</b></p>
            <p>Compared to traditional production, modern table olive acreage features:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>higher-density planting of ~200 - 250 trees/acre (compared to less than 100 trees/acre)</li>
                <li>
                  yields up to 6+ tons/acre (compared to 10-year industry average of 3.25 tons/acre)
                </li>
              <li>mechanical harvesting (compared to hand labor, which is more costly and not always available)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The webinar will feature Dan Flynn, founding director of the UC Davis Olive Center, who will summarize key elements of siting, establishing, maintaining and harvesting modern acreage.
