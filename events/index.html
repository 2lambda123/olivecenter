            <h2>Free webinar on modern acreage for table olives </h2>
            <p><b>June 23, 9:00 – 10:30 AM</b></p>
            <p>Compared to traditional production, modern table olive acreage features:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>higher-density planting of ~200 - 250 trees/acre (compared to less than 100 trees/acre)</li>
                <li>
                  yields up to 6+ tons/acre (compared to 10-year industry average of 3.25 tons/acre)
                </li>
              <li>mechanical harvesting (compared to hand labor, which is more costly and not always available)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The webinar will feature Dan Flynn, founding director of the UC Davis Olive Center, who will summarize key elements of siting, establishing, maintaining and harvesting modern acreage. He will be joined by Dennis Burreson, an olive grower and vice-president of field operations and industry affairs for the Musco Family Olive Company. Dennis will discuss his experience in modern table olive acreage for the past 12 years
            </p>
            <p>
