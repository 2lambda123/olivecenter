            <h2>Free webinar on modern acreage for table olives </h2>
            <p><b>June 23, 9:00 – 10:30 AM</b></p>
            <p>Compared to traditional production, modern table olive acreage features:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>higher-density planting of ~200 - 250 trees/acre (compared to less than 100 trees/acre)</li>
                <li>
                  yields up to 6+ tons/acre (compared to 10-year industry average of 3.25 tons/acre)
                </li>
              <li>mechanical harvesting (compared to hand labor, which is more costly and not always available)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The webinar will feature Dan Flynn, founding director of the UC Davis Olive Center, who will summarize key elements of siting, establishing, maintaining and harvesting modern acreage. He will be joined by Dennis Burreson, an olive grower and vice-president of field operations and industry affairs for the Musco Family Olive Company. Dennis will discuss his experience in modern table olive acreage for the past 12 years
            </p>
            <p>

            <h2>Master Milling Certificate Course</h2>
            <p><b>September 21-23, 2020</b></p>
            <p>The Master Milling Certificate Course has helped hundreds of olive oil processors produce better oil more efficiently. The course will be led by Leandro Ravetti, among the world’s top experts in olive oil processing, growing, and standards. As executive director of Australia’s Boundary Bend Limited, Leandro has helped guide the company to rapid growth, optimum efficiency, and top awards at international olive oil competitions. </p>
            <p><b>Reviews from 2019 Course:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>“Without this class, we would not be able to make high-quality, award-winning extra virgin olive oil. The price of this seminar is a bargain. As an investment, the first year’s crop paid for the class many times over.”</li>
              <li>“The course covers some of the most advanced approaches to milling available, but also covers the basic fundamentals. What I learned immediately is that a lot of the old milling ‘lore’ circulating the industry in California simply wasn’t true or backed by any evidence. The course is a huge first step in demystifying the milling process so we can innovate and produce better oils.”</li>
            </ul>
